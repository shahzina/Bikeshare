# Predicting Bikeshare

Predict the bikeshare usage for December given the data for last 60 days. 

The graph below shows the rider data for the first 10 days of December.

## Building our neural network in Python:

For this project we are building our own neural network from scratch. We start by creating a Neural Network class where we beginning with the init function and set the number of input, hidden and output nodes. We also define our activation function and learning rate in the init function. The values for hidden nodes, output nodes and the learning rate are set later and can be changed until we get desired accuracy. The init function is executed when a new instance is created and is used to set initial values for the attribute of the instance.


The training and validation loss was as follows:
